# Charts - Toolbar ðŸ§ª

<p class="description">Charts can display a toolbar for easier access to certain functionality.</p>

:::info
This feature is in preview. It is ready for production use, but its API, visuals and behavior may change in future minor or patch releases.
:::

Charts provide a toolbar that can be enabled to give users quick access to certain features.

The toolbar is available on scatter, bar, line, pie and radar charts.

To enable the toolbar, set the `showToolbar` prop to `true` on the chart component.

:::info
The toolbar is only displayed if there are actions available.

For example, if the chart is not zoomable, the zoom buttons will not be displayed.

## Customization

The toolbar is highly customizable, built to integrate with any design system.

### Slots

TODO: How to differentiate these slots from "composition" slots?

That is achievable by passing the custom elements to `slots` prop of the chart.

{{"demo": "ChartsToolbarCustomElements.js"}}

### Render prop

You can use the `render` prop to customize the rendering of certain elements.

```tsx
<ToolbarButton render={<MyButton />} />
```

Alternatively, you can pass a function to the `render` prop, which will receive the props and state as arguments.

```tsx
<ToolbarButton render={(props, state) => <MyButton {...props} />} />
```

You can see an example of this in the [composition](#composition) section.

### Composition

If you want to further customize the toolbar's functionality, you can also partially or entirely replace it with a custom implementation.
